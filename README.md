## Endpoints
- To send requests to this app's endpoints you should register a new user first.

For this purpose use this endpoint:
```code
POST /api/auth/registration
```
the request body should look like this:
```JSON
{
     "email":"your@email.com",
     "password":"password",
     "repeatPassword":"password",
     "firstName":"Johny",
     "lastName":"Blaze"
}
```
Use the response token on the login endpoint to proceed.
Or step over with a pre-registered user right to the next endpoint:

```code
POST /api/auth/login
```
You can use this one:
```JSON
{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "12345678"
}
```
- You can retrieve the list of all stored books with a request to this endpoint:

```code
GET /api/books
```
Or find a book by ID with this endpoint:
```code
GET /api/books/{id}
```
Or even search 🕵️‍♂️ for books with this one("authors" and/or "titles" in params):
